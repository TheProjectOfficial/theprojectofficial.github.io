  <p>Aurora is Reconnected. We still need some time to finish up the Website, so that is fully functioning. <br>UPDATE: We have moved our website, access the new link <a href="https://hoshiproject.ct.ws">Here</a></p>
  <p>From now on, everything will run from that url, not from this one here anymore :(</p>
